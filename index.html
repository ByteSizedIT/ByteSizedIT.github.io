        <h2>ByteSizedIT</h2>
        <p>While addressing key learning objectives from the new computing curriculum, ByteSizedIT programmes give children the
        opportunity to apply problem solving, math and creative thinking skills, producing projects that allow their ideas and
        personalities to shine.<br>
        <p><strong>Feedback for ByteSizedIT:</strong><br>
        <p><strong><em>Assistant Head</em></strong>: “I have just had the chance to look at the children’s projects in detail I wanted to say how impressed I am with
        what they have produced...Thanks for your passion and hard work."<br>
        <strong><em>Parent:</em></strong> “Computer coding club made a huge difference on my son’s thinking ... He is not just playing games on the computer any
        more but ‘making’ them himself... He is proudly talking about how he directs characters, backgrounds and music ... he is not just
        playing his own game quietly in his room but presenting it to us, even explaining details, so we can communicate more often.”<br>
        <strong><em>TA:</em></strong> “... it built confidence in some children whilst others excelled in their IT knowledge. The children’s ability just grew and
        grew and they really enjoyed making their own games ... Some children have gone home and shown siblings how to code.”<br>
        <strong><em>Child:</em></strong> “I love coding club because it’s fun. Now I know all the different techniques I can make my own games at home and code them
        to work however I want.”
