# Founders and Coders Application

This is a one-page website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was created as part of my application for the [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com) course.

[Course Prequisites](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/apply/) include creating a personal webpage that does not use any JavaScript or CSS libraries like Bootstrap or jQuery. While the website must include a built in carousel, it could not an image carousel package like Flickity.

Founders and Coders is a UK-based nonprofit that develops and runs tuition-free training programmes in web development, guided by our core values of cooperation, inclusion and social impact.
